			description: 'We envision the Next Level Oncology concierge practice as a community of real people and real families with stories, dreams and wishes that deserve to be heard, and with complex and demanding lives and illnesses like cancer that deserve the utmost attention to detail and respect. <br><br> When  our patients call, we answer, and when they feel sick or worried or simply have questions we make time for them. We may travel to their homes when needed and can be with them through the hardest and most difficult times or simply just to listen in the comfort of one’s home surrounded by their loved ones. The cancer journey is unique and complicated but there are still many opportunities for celebration. Your concierge doctor will be with you as much in celebration as in illness. It is a powerful form of practice, rooted in the community relationships of the Old World and dedicated to a deeply personal vision of cancer care and healthcare in general—one that is too often lost in the medical landscape of today.'

			title: 'Changes in Medicine',
			description: 'Medicine changed drastically over the last decade, as physicians struggle to manage immense rosters of patients while unfortunately the number of patients with cancer is on the continued rise, and where the increasingly complex demands of medical bureaucracy are overwhelming the ability of large practices and hospitals to build meaningful relationships with the people in their care. It is both alarming and upsetting that patients grow accustomed to not knowing their doctors, even as they feel more daunted by the medical system they’re required to navigate in times of need when urgency and attention to the patient matter most.'

			title: 'Patient-first approach',

At Next Level Oncology, we’re dedicated to providing better and happier lives by building deeper, more lasting connections to our patients. We combine our patient-first values with the best of personalized diagnostics, preventative care and treatments both supportive and therapeutic to treat the person as a whole, and to help our patients achieve their fullest and best lives possible. To make that possible, we’ve committed ourselves to getting to know you, because we believe that you deserve more than the highest quality of care. We believe that you deserve exceptional care on your own terms, based on your needs, just as you are. That’s our promise and we hold ourselves to it.'
