			title: 'Early Life and Inspiration',
			description: 'By the time she was in elementary school she was determined to become a doctor. Unfortunately during this time her grandmother passed away from cancer. From that point on, it was her grandfather that became her primary caretaker and she spent time with her grandfather helping him on the farm before and after school. She got her optimism from her grandfather who had a very challenging life but he had the utmost optimism and hope for a better future for his family.',

			title: 'Path To Medicine',
			description: 'Just as Dr Csiki began her MD/PhD studies, her grandfather was diagnosed with very advanced colorectal cancer. He passed away a few months after his diagnosis in 2001, never having received any treatment for the cancer due to his advanced illness and medical practice limitations of that time. Dr Csiki spent the remaining time of his life caring for him. His death in August 2001 left profound sadness but also determination to dedicate her career to advancing cancer research and enable patients the choice and opportunity to access therapies that can help live a better life. Furthermore, Dr Csiki wanted to ensure that patients receive the type of access and personal care she would have wanted her grandfather to have. <br><br> She completed her MD and the PhD in the field of Cancer Biology at Vanderbilt University, pursuing innovative research and later specialized in the care of cancer patients. It was this relentless pursuit of combining innovative cancer research with the best patient care and therapeutics available that got her excited to accept a faculty position at the University of Pennsylvania where she continued to focus on cancer research and care of cancer patients. She took on clinical research positions at the top oncology companies including Merck and led development of novel drugs such as the immunotherapy, Keytruda. After an exciting career on the East Coast, Dr Csiki was recruited to City of Hope in Southern California to continue advancing cancer research, prevention and care of patients. She is dedicated to educating patients to be able to access the best care. She also helped patients get access to innovative, novel medicines from biotechs when no further therapy was available yet patients wanted to continue to fight. Through this process she became intimately familiar with expanded access and compassionate use programs that patients can participate in and helped other physicians navigate this process. <br><br> Drawing from over two decades of both personal and professional experiences alongside cancer patients, Dr. Csiki has witnessed firsthand the challenges and limitations faced by even the finest hospitals in providing a truly comprehensive and compassionate care experience for both patients and their families. These experiences inspired  Dr. Csiki to establish something unique in the space of cancer care and prevention. Thus was born the first genuine oncology concierge practice in Southern California, and indeed anywhere, with a dedicated focus on longevity, prevention, and care. This practice stands as a testament to our commitment to deliver unparalleled, personalized care that speaks directly to the hearts of our patients and their families, ensuring they feel supported, understood, and valued at every step of their journey.'
