				<h2>About us</h2>
				<h4>
					When we founded Next Level Oncology as a concierge practice, we were inspired by the courage, hope and endless trust that patients placed in their physician throughout their journey from diagnosis to the end of life. We saw that when the patient and the physician are connected on the care journey, as if holding hands, while many unknowns remain, the patient never feels alone and hopeless.

					<h4>Close relationships</h4>
					<p class="faded">
						We envision the Next Level Oncology concierge practice as a community of real people and real families with stories, dreams and wishes that deserve to be heard, and with complex and demanding lives and illnesses like cancer that deserve the utmost attention to detail and respect. When patients call, we answer, and when they feel sick or worried or simply have questions we make time for them. <b>We may travel to their homes when needed and can be with them through the hardest and most difficult times or simply just to listen in the comfort</b> of one’s home surrounded by their loved ones. The cancer journey is unique and complicated but there are still many opportunities for celebration. <b>Your concierge doctor will be with you as much in celebration as in illness.</b> It is a powerful form of practice, rooted in the community relationships of the Old World and dedicated to a deeply personal vision of cancer care and healthcare in general — one that is too often lost in the medical landscape of today.

					<h4>Medical bureaucracy</h4>
					<p class="faded">
						Medicine changed drastically over the last decade, as physicians struggle to manage immense rosters of patients, and where the increasingly complex demands of <b>medical bureaucracy are overwhelming the ability of large practices and hospitals to build meaningful relationships with the people in their care.</b> Most alarmingly, we’ve seen patients grow accustomed to not knowing their doctors, even as they feel more daunted by the medical system they’re required to navigate in times of need when urgency and attention to the patient matter most. <b>Our mission is to change that.</b>
